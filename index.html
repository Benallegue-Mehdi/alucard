        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Alucard is the dhampir (half-human, half-vampire) son of Dracula, the antagonist of the Castlevania series, and his mother Lisa.</p>
        
        <p>Lisa created medicine for those who suffered from the epidemic. Due to the witch trials in Europe at the time, Lisa was apprehended and executed. Alucard was present shortly before Lisa's death, but his mother requested that he allowed the mob to kill her, under the belief that it would ultimately save their souls from eternal damnation.</p>

        <p>Upon learning about his wife's death, Dracula vowed revenge. In 1476, he began his war upon humanity. However, his mother's death and admonition not to hate humanity caused Alucard to take up arms against his father.</p>
